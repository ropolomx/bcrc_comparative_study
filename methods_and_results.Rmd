The reads were analyzed in the Galaxy instance of the National Microbiology Laboratory
(Public Health Agency of Canada). The workflow used in this study was based on the 
workflow utilized in a previous study, but with the addition of the characterization of
biocide and biometal results.

### Data analysis
